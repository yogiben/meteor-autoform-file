### I'm having an issue:
 1. Search [issues](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/meteor-autoform-file/issues), maybe your issue is already solved
 2. Before submitting an issue make sure it's only related to `Meteor-Files` package
 3. If your issue is not solved:
     - Give an expressive description of what is went wrong
     - Version of `ostrio:autoform-files` and `ostrio:files` you're experiencing this issue
     - Version of `Meteor` you're experiencing this issue
     - Is it *Client* or *Server* issue?
     - Post *Client* and/or *Server* logs with enabled `debug` option, you can enable "debug" mode in [*Constructor*](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/wiki/Constructor)

### I have a suggestion:
 1. PRs are always welcome - [send a PR](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/meteor-autoform-file/compare)
 2. If you're can not send a PR for some reason:
     - Create a new issue ticket
     - Describe your feature / request
     - How you going to use it? Give a usage example(s)

### Documentation is missing something or incorrect (have typos, etc.):
 1. PRs are always welcome - [send a PR](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/meteor-autoform-file/compare)
 2. If you're can not send a PR to docs for some reason:
     - Create a new issue ticket
     - Give an expressive description what you have changed/added and why
     - Make sure you're using correct markdown markup
     - Make sure all code blocks starts with triple ``` (*backtick*) and have a syntax tag, for more read [this docs](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/#syntax-highlighting)
